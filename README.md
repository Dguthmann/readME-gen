## resources Used

Zachary Auerbach for help with some modulization and helping with suggestions for how to approach my future dev goals.  


## Further Development Plans

More futureproofing, was trying for one that prompted user for if they had screenshots, or number of files to ask for that specifically otherwise leave out stuff, but the nesting functions were being challenging with promise errors. Working in the gif is a challenge to attempt better since the low quality is restricted to make sure the repo doesn't go above 100 MB.
